1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the CSS files for styling. It will contain DOM elements with unique id names that can be used for styling and scripting purposes.

2. "styles.css": This is the custom CSS file that will contain styles specific to the website. It will use class and id selectors that match those in the index.html file. It will also import the Tailwind CSS file for utility classes.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the Tailwind CSS file that will provide utility classes for styling. It will be imported into the styles.css file.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for elements in the HTML file. They will be used in the CSS files for styling specific elements. For example, ids like "header", "footer", "main-content" might be used.

2. CSS Class Names: These are identifiers that can be used on multiple elements in the HTML file. They will be defined in the CSS files and used for applying the same style to multiple elements. For example, classes like "text-center", "bg-dark", "text-white" might be used.

3. CSS Import: The Tailwind CSS file will be imported into the custom CSS file. This allows the utility classes from Tailwind to be used in the custom CSS file.

4. HTML Link: The custom CSS file will be linked in the HTML file. This allows the styles defined in the CSS file to be applied to the HTML elements.

5. Tailwind Utility Classes: These are classes provided by Tailwind CSS for styling. They will be used in the HTML file and possibly in the custom CSS file. For example, classes like "container", "mx-auto", "p-4" might be used.
